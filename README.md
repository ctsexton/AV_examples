Amplitude_to_Brightness.maxpat - this simple Max patch takes input from a microphone and maps the amplitude to the values of a jitter matrix, which is then fed to a video output. The result is an interactive video feed where volume is translated to brightness/intensity of (white) pixels. Low latency so very responsive!
